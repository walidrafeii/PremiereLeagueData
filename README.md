## Premier League Historical Data

Goal: collect accurate historical data for all Premiere League games since 2000-2001 season.<br>

Reason: The data will be prepared to be used to predict this season's head-to-head winners.<br>

Collected Data: The data collected will be across all teams that played in the most recent season.<br>
Please note that older teams that used to play in the premiere league will be ignored as we are not<br>
interested in any data for older teams (they don't play anymore).
